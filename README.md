4. **Showing All Cars**: The program allows displaying all existing cars in the system, along with their details.

Technologies and paradigms used in the program:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes and objects are used to organize and manage the application's logic and car data.
2. **Scanner**: Used to read user inputs from the keyboard.
3. **Exception Handling**: Used to manage and handle exceptions that may occur during program execution.
4. **Java Collections Framework**: Utilized for managing and manipulating collections of cars within the application.
5. **Switch-Case**: Employed to direct the program flow based on the user-selected option.
6. **Methods and Flow Control**: Methods are used to organize code into logical units and facilitate code reuse and readability. Flow control (loops, conditions) is used to manage user interactions and logical execution of the program.

Together, these functionalities and technologies create a simple and interactive Java application for car management.
